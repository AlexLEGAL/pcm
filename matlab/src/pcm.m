%
% Version 1.0
% A Profile Classification Model (PCM) structure can have the following fields:
% 
% GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES
% 	readme:  
% 	Np: Number of profiles used when the model was trained
% 
% INTERPOLATION 	
% 	DPTmodel: The vertical depth axis of the model (negative, downward)
%
% NORMALIZATION
% 	normalization
% 	X_ave
% 	X_std
% 
% REDUCTION
% 	doREDUCE: Do we compress the data with PCA or not ?
% 	EOFs: Eigenvectors of the reduced space
% 	X_ref: Center of the array used in PCA
% 	V: Variance of each of the PCA dimensions
% 	maxvar: The effective variance retainted within the reduced space
% 
% CLASSIFICATION MODEL
% 	covarTYPE:
% 	K: The number of class in the GMM model
%	LLH: Negative Log likelihood of the GMM
%	mix: The Netlab GMM structure
