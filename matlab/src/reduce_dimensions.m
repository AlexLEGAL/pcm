% 
% Reduce the dimension of a dataset with PCA. 
% X is a collection of profiles with a large number of vertical 
% levels. This routine is used to reduced that number.
%
% Inputs:
% 	X [Nz,Np] : a collection of Np profiles (cols) with Nz vertical levels (rows).
% 	EXPVAR : the fraction of variance between 0 and 100% that must be 
% 		retained in the reduced dataset.
%
% Outputs:
%	Xr [Nc,Np] : the collection of Np profiles in the reduced Nc-dimensional 
% 		space of EOFs, ie the Principal component scores or PCs.
% 	B [Nz,Nc] : profiles defining the new Nc-dimensional space, ie the 
% 		Principal component coefficients or EOFs.
% 	V [1,Nc] : the fraction of variance explained by individual axis of the
% 		new space.
% 	L [1,Nc] : Principal component variances, ie eigenvalues of the covariance 
% 		matrix.
% 	Xref [Nz,1] : is the sample mean of the input collection X, used as as reference
% 		to center the collection.
%  	Xp [Nz,Np] : the re-composed collection, to be compared with X.
%	Xrnorm [Nc,Np] : Normalized Principal component scores.
% 	Breal [Nz,Nc] : profiles defining the new Nc-dimensional space with their 
% 		dimensional units.
%
% The re-composed collection is the backward projection of the reduced dataset onto
% the original Nz-dimensional space: Xp = B*Xr + repmat(Xref,[1 size(Xr,2)]);

% Remove the sample mean profile:
