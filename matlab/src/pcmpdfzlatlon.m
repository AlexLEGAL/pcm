function varargout = pcmpdfzlatlon(GMMMASK,PCM,DPT,FIELD,M,varargin)
% pcmpdfzlatlon Compute the PDF at each depth levels (PDFz) from a PCM and a given collection of gridded profiles
%
% [PDFz,X,PDFzO,PDFzM] = pcmpdfzlatlon(MASK,PCM,DPT,DATA,M,[PAR,VAL])
%
% REQUIRED INPUTS:
% 	MASK(Ny,Nx): 0/1 mask to define profiles to classify in the lat/lon grid
%	MODEL (struct): A Profile Classification Model structure
% 	DPT(Nz,1): Depth axis of DATA (used to call pcmpredict and get the activation values)
% 	DATA(Nz,Ny,Nx): A gridded collection of profiles
% 	M: if M is a scalar, uses M bins, but if M is a vector, returns 
% 		the PDFz of DATA among bins with centers specified by M.
% 
% OPTIONAL INPUTS as [PAR,VAL]: List of optional parameters/values: 
% 	REDUCED: 0 (default) / 1: Indicate if DATA is reduced or not. If it's reduced
% 		real data will be recomposed using MODEL info.
% 	WEIGHT(Np,K): Possibly provide the profile weights to use to compute histograms.
% 		If not provided, DATA is classified using pcmpredict and ACTIVATIONS are used.
% 	CLASS: A list of integers to specify the class to determine
%
% OUTPUTS:
% 	PDFz(Nz,X,K): PDFz for each class of the model
% 	X: Also returns the position of the bin centers
% 	PDFzO(Nz,M): Observed PDFz from the entire collection
% 	PDFzM(Nz,M): Model PDFz from the prior weighted sum of PDFz

d = permute(FIELD,[1 3 2]); % Z,Y,X to Z,X,Y
ikeep = find(c(:)==1);
X = d(:,ikeep); % Z, P for pfoiles over the mask=1

%- Outputs
