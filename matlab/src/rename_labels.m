function [newlabels knew wm0] = rename_labels(labels,weights,scalar,mode)
% reorder_labels Re-name labels IDs
%
% [NEW_LABELS KLIST VAL] = rename_labels(LABELS,WEIGHT,SCALAR,MODE) 
%
% Create new labels according to the WEIGHT-weighted mean value of SCALAR
% of each class. MODE selects the direction of the sort.
% 
% Inputs:
%	LABELS(Np,1): Labels of the profiles, an integer between 1 and K
% 	WEIGHT(Np,1): A weight vector
% 	SCALAR(Np,1): A scalar value for each profile
% 	MODE: A string indicating the direction of the sort:
% 		'ascend' results in ascending order
%		'descend' results in descending order
% 
% Outputs:
%	NEW_LABELS(Np,1): The new labels
% 	KLIST(1,K): The old to new Class id ordering
% 	VAL(1,K): The K WEIGHT-weighted mean values of SCALAR used to re-order labels.
% 
% Eg:
% 	Create new labels so that the lowest class label has the smallest mean SST:
% 		[oLABELS Klist Ksst] = rename_labels(LABELS,ACTI,SST,'ascend');
