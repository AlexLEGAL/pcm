function NewMatrix = covarrotate(Matrix, theta, ScaleRatio)
% covarrotate Rotate a squared covariance matrix
%
% rC = covarrotate(C, THETA) Rotate a covariance matrix
%
% Inputs:
%	C(D,D): Squared covariance matrix to rotate
% 	THETA: The angle in deg. to rotate (positive, clockwise)
% 
% Outputs:
%	rC: The C matrix rotated by THETA
