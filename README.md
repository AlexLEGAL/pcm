Profile Classification Modelling (PCM)
======================================

**Profile Classification Modelling** is an emerging scientific analysis approach based on vertical profiles classification that can be used in a variety of oceanographic problems (front detection, water mass identification, natural region contouring, reference profile selection for validation, etc ...).

It is being developed at Ifremer/LOPS with collaboration with Telecom Bretagne since 2015 and is now mature enough (with publication and communications) to be distributed and made available publicly for continuous improvements with a community development.

## Matlab toolbox
This is the original code for PCM.
    
[You can get started following this help page](https://github.com/obidam/pcm/blob/master/matlab/README.md)

@gmaze will provide help to use it, but won't maintain the code. Contact us if you want to contribute !

## Python package
We are currently developing a Python package to work with PCM easily. 

Before the initial release, you can [check out the
classic PCM workflow on this notebook](https://github.com/obidam/pcm/blob/master/python/PCM-workflow-classic-demo.ipynb).

## Install

Clone the toolbox from the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/obidam/pcm.git
    
As of now, both the Matlab and Python PCM codes are under the same repository, this will probably change in the future.
